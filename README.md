# analytics_lab_assigments
This repository contains the final project completed during the Analytics Lab course (Winter Semester 2023-24).
The project focuses on finding possible relationships between the purchasing habits of fashion retail consumers in the UK and the US by building linear models, plotting residuals, and running t-tests using R. The data set is designed to mimic the real sales process in the fashion industry. It offers a realistic representation of sales transactions, customer preferences, and product characteristics.
